# Search And Optimization Algorithms
This repository contains my work on improvising the optimization algorithms. It contains the respective Matlab code and the research work is documented.

research_work_1 contains an algorithm on multiple variable optimization using conjugate gradient methods. The algorithm is run with a linear function and non-linear function. Further details of the implementation is explained in the document.

research_work_2 contains an algorithm to minimize the loss function in neural networks using conjugate gradient method.

The research works are based on the teachings done by Dr. Dirk Arnold. https://web.cs.dal.ca/~dirk/
