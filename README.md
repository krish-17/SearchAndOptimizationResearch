# Search And Optimization Algorithms
This repository contains my work on improvising the optimization algorithms. It contains the respective Matlab code and the research work is documented.

First document contains an algorithm on multiple variable optimization using conjugate gradient methods. The algorithm is run with a linear function and non-linear function. Further details of the implementation is explained in the document.

Second document contains an algorithm to minimize the loss function in neural networks using conjugate gradient method.

The research works are based on the teachings done by Dr. Dirk Arnold. https://web.cs.dal.ca/~dirk/
